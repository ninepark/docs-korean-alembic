"this section is a technical overview of the **internal API of Alembic**. "
"This section is only useful for developers who wish to extend the "
"capabilities of Alembic; for regular users, reading this section is **not"
" necessary**."

"A visualization of the primary features of Alembic's internals is "
"presented in the following figure.   The module and class boxes do not "
"list out all the operations provided by each unit; only a small set of "
"representative elements intended to convey the primary purpose of each "
"system."

"The script runner for Alembic is present in the "
":ref:`alembic.config.toplevel` module. This module produces a "
":class:`.Config` object and passes it to the appropriate function in "
":ref:`alembic.command.toplevel`.   Functions within "
":ref:`alembic.command.toplevel` will typically instantiate an "
":class:`.ScriptDirectory` instance, which represents the collection of "
"version files, and an :class:`.EnvironmentContext`, which is a "
"configurational facade passed to the environment's ``env.py`` script."
msgstr ""

#: ../api/overview.rst:26
msgid ""
"The :class:`.EnvironmentContext` object is the primary object used within"
" the ``env.py`` script, whose main purpose is that of a facade for "
"creating and using a :class:`.MigrationContext` object, which is the "
"actual migration engine that refers to a database implementation.   The "
"primary method called on this object within an ``env.py`` script is the "
":meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure` method, which sets up the "
":class:`.MigrationContext` with database connectivity and behavioral "
"configuration.  It also supplies methods for transaction demarcation and "
"migration running, but these methods ultimately call upon the "
":class:`.MigrationContext` that's been configured."

#: ../api/overview.rst:37
msgid ""
":class:`.MigrationContext` is the gateway to the database for other parts"
" of the application, and produces a :class:`.DefaultImpl` object which "
"does the actual database communication, and knows how to create the "
"specific SQL text of the various DDL directives such as ALTER TABLE; "
":class:`.DefaultImpl` has subclasses that are per-database-backend. In "
"\"offline\" mode (e.g. ``--sql``), the :class:`.MigrationContext` will "
"produce SQL to a file output stream instead of a database."
msgstr ""

#: ../api/overview.rst:45
msgid ""
"During an upgrade or downgrade operation, a specific series of migration "
"scripts are invoked starting with the :class:`.MigrationContext` in "
"conjunction with the :class:`.ScriptDirectory`; the actual scripts "
"themselves make use of the :class:`.Operations` object, which provide the"
" end-user interface to specific database operations.   The "
":class:`.Operations` object is generated based on a series of \"operation"
" directive\" objects that are user-extensible, and start out in the "
":ref:`alembic.operations.ops.toplevel` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../api/overview.rst:53
msgid ""
"Another prominent feature of Alembic is the \"autogenerate\" feature, "
"which produces new migration scripts that contain Python code.  The "
"autogenerate feature starts in :ref:`alembic.autogenerate.toplevel`, and "
"is used exclusively by the :func:`.alembic.command.revision` command when"
" the ``--autogenerate`` flag is passed.  Autogenerate refers to the "
":class:`.MigrationContext` and :class:`.DefaultImpl` in order to access "
"database connectivity and access per-backend rules for autogenerate "
"comparisons.  It also makes use of :ref:`alembic.operations.ops.toplevel`"
" in order to represent the operations that it will render into scripts."
